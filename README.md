# Hey, I'm Ethan

**Data Architect @ Eli Lilly | Open Source Contributor | Lakehouse Enthusiast**

I'm passionate about building the next generation of data infrastructure. By day, I architect analytics platforms in the pharmaceutical industry. Outside of work, I contribute to open source and stay hands-on with the systems shaping modern data platforms.
